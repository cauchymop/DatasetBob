TODO
====

* Change Permission to app only
  * It does not seem to work after all!!! :-(
  * Instead: USE FIREBASE TO HANDLE DATASETS DEFINITIONS + EXPORT TO DRIVE
  * Implement a Dataset editor to:
    * create a dataset
    * create its labels
    * share with emails

* In GalleryFragment:
  DatasetSelector
* Replace Task in DriveServiceHelper with coroutines

* add kotlin extensions to make Tasks nicer
* Fix layout bug when more than 4 categories
* introduce dagger2 because it's time
* Better UI for current dataset and label
* In ViewModel:
    Maybe LiveData to expose signin state
