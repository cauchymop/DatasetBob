TODO
====

* Load the list of labels from folders below "DATASET_BOB"
* The only thing needed to configure is the folder (or name of the Dataset below DATASET_BOB)
* At startup the app reads the list of folders below a given dataset, this is the list of labels
* When we classify, we copy the image to the right folder (no rename needed anymore possibly)

* For sync:
** For each file:
*** If it's already uploaded, check its folder (and change it if needed)
*** Or upload it in the right folder.
